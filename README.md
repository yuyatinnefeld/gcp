## About
Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure 
that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, file storage, and YouTube.
Alongside a set of management tools, it provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, 
data storage, data analytics and machine learning. Registration requires a credit card or bank account details.(wikipedia)
